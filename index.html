    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2><pid="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website
        from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
        <pid="web-security-answer">
            I would advice the client to follow these best practices in web security:</p>
            <h3>1. Sanitazation of data.</h3> They should either manually or by using a well-known third-party-solution
            make sure
            the data they receive on the website is clean and in the correct format.</p>

            <h3>2. Secure authorization and authetication.</h3> They should take measures to ensure that only authorized
            users
            can access what they are permittet to access. OneLogin and Okta could be helpful tools for this.</p>

            <h3> 3. Using tristworthy third-party apps. </h3>Before starting to use a third-party application, I would
            highly
            suggest for the client to research the apps. Cheap/free is very often not good. A look at how many times per
            week the app is downloaded would be recommended.</p>

            <h3> 4. Continous Deployment/Continous Integration.</h3> I would recommend the client to set up automatic
            processes to
            check, test and deploy code.</p>

            <h3> 5. Network security.</h3> The client should also make sure to protect the data that moves between
            computers and
            servers.</p>

            <h3> 6. Automatic user timeout.</h3> Lastly I would advise that the client sets up automatic user timeout so
            that the
            user gets kicked out of the website if they have been inactive for a certain amount of time. This is a
            measure that can prevent wrong users from getting access if the right user forgets to log out.</p>

    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website
        from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        I would advise the client to follow these best practices in web security:</p>
    <h3>1. Sanitization of data.</h3>
    <p>They should either manually or by using a well-known third-party solution
        make sure the data they receive on the website is clean and in the correct format.</p>

    <h3>2. Secure authorization and authentication.</h3>
    <p>They should take measures to ensure that only authorized users can access what they are permitted to
        access. OneLogin and Okta could be helpful tools for this.
    </p>

    <h3> 3. Using trustworthy third-party apps. </h3>
    <p>Before starting to use a third-party application, I would
        highly suggest for the client to research the apps. Cheap/free is very often not good. A look at how
        many times per week the app is downloaded would be recommended.</p>

    <h3> 4. Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration.</h3>
    <p>I would recommend the client to set up automatic processes to check, test and deploy code.</p>

    <h3> 5. Network security.</h3>
    <p>The client should also make sure to protect the data that moves between computers and servers.</p>

    <h3> 6. Automatic user timeout.</h3>
    <p>Lastly I would advise that the client sets up automatic user timeout so
        that the user gets kicked out of the website if they have been inactive for a certain amount of time.
        This is a
        measure that can prevent wrong users from getting access if the right user forgets to log out.</p>
